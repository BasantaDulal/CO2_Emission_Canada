### Introduction
In this project we are going to use Environment - CO2 Emission dataset to produce a Tableau dashboard. While creating the dashboard the approaches like pre-attentrive attributes, thinking like a designer etc. will be used to make our visualization more effective. We are also using brand color of the institution to make the the dashboard relevant to that company. In this case, we have representing David Suzuki Foundation and trying to convery relevent information on their behalf.

### Data Cleansing
In order to cleanse the data, I used Tableau Prep Builder. The duplicate values were removed and the abbrivated name of Transmission and Fuel type were decoded from the metadata sheet. After, this the dataset looks good for further process.

### Reason for choosing the visualization in Dashboard
