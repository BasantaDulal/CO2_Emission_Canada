## CO2 Emission Canada: Dashboard and Storytelling

### Introduction
In this project we are going to use Environment - CO2 Emission dataset to produce a Tableau dashboard. While creating the dashboard the approaches like pre-attentrive attributes, thinking like a designer etc. will be used to make our visualization more effective. We are also using brand color of the institution to make the the dashboard relevant to that company. In this case, we have representing David Suzuki Foundation and trying to convery relevent information on their behalf.

### Data Cleansing
In order to cleanse the data, I used Tableau Prep Builder. The duplicate values were removed and the abbrivated name of Transmission and Fuel type were decoded from the metadata sheet. After, this the dataset looks good for further process. In the second visual, we are trying to examine the relationship between Fuel Consumption and CO2 emission so, scatterplots would be the best option for that. 

### Reason for choosing the visualization in Dashboard
A pie chart is mostly used visual but need to use with precaution as it is used wrongly most of the time. In first visual, the pie chart would be the best option as there are five types of fuels in this dataset and we want to know their proportions. In the second visual, we are trying to examine the relationship between Fuel Consumption and CO2 emission so, scatterplots would be the best option for it. In the third visual, we have the number of models and in the fourth visual, we have the number of brands which are categorical variables. Hence, to present that information simply and understandably, the horizontal bar charts are the best option.

### Use of color theme in Dashboard
While preparing the dashboard I picked the theme colors from David Suzuki Foundationâ€™s logo in which there are three colors: Navy blue, Turkish Blue, and Carolina Blue. The Navy blue was used in the headings and annotations in the graphs. Turkish Blue was used as the background color of the graphs and Carolina Blue was used to represent Ethanol (E85) which plays a vital role in our story.

### Data Narrative and Storytelling
This dataset provides various information which can be analyzed from a different perspective. As an environmental organization, our purpose would be to minimize CO2 emissions. So, to achieve this goal we are trying to show the consumers and car companies, how we can reduce CO2 emissions by using a particular fuel on vehicles. The first pie chart shows the proportion of vehicles based on fuel type. There it is clear that the regular gasoline and premium gasoline fuel type vehicles have a high prevalence in Canada. Ethanol (E85) and Diesel have small proportions and Natural Gas has a negligible proportion. Further, the second visual: the scatter plot examines the relationship between fuel type and CO2 emission. Here, vehicles with Ethanol (E85) are found to produce less CO2 in the environment compared to others. Its increase rate with fuel consumption is also less than others.

After knowing this fact, we further drill down and investigate how many models are being sold by each manufacturer which is shown in the third visual. Chevrolet has 35 models with E85 fuel which is the highest among all brands followed by GMC and Ford. Moreover, the fourth visual shows number of brand options for consumers in each vehicle class who wants to buy an E85 fuel-based vehicle. It is clear that if a consumer wants to buy SUV-Standard E85 fuel based he/she will have nine brands to choose from. The main aim of the dashboard would be to tell the audience that despite of high prevalence of gasoline-based vehicles in the market, we have to promote E85 fuel-based vehicles to decrease CO2 emissions.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, when we have to prepare the dashboard and tell stories from it, the underlying dataset needs to be understood and examined first. It needs to be cleaned properly to avoid misleading insights. After that, we need to be careful about choosing the right visual to make the audience understand the story. Moreover, there should be proper labels, titles, and annotations to aid in making the dashboard clear. Further, the dashboard should have appropriate colors that represent the organization such as the use of their brand color or color from their logo to represent the organization.
