### Introduction
In this project we are going to use Environment - CO2 Emission dataset to produce a Tableau dashboard. While creating the dashboard the approaches like pre-attentrive attributes, thinking like a designer etc. will be used to make our visualization more effective. We are also using brand color of the institution to make the the dashboard relevant to that company. In this case, we have representing David Suzuki Foundation and trying to convery relevent information on their behalf.

### Data Cleansing
In order to cleanse the data, I used Tableau Prep Builder. The duplicate values were removed and the abbrivated name of Transmission and Fuel type were decoded from the metadata sheet. After, this the dataset looks good for further process. In the second visual, we are trying to examine the relationship between Fuel Consumption and CO2 emission so, scatterplots would be the best option for that. 

### Reason for choosing the visualization in Dashboard
A pie chart is mostly used visual but need to use with precaution as it is used wrongly most of the time. In first visual, the pie chart would be the best option as there are five types of fuels in this dataset and we want to know their proportions. In the third visual, we have the number of models and in the fourth visual, we have the number of brands which are categorical variables. Hence, to present that information simply and understandably, the horizontal bar charts are the best option.

### Use of color theme in Dashboard
While preparing the dashboard I picked the theme colors from David Suzuki Foundationâ€™s logo in which there are three colors: Navy blue, Turkish Blue, and Carolina Blue. The Navy blue is used in the headings and annotations in the graphs. Turkish Blue is used as the background color of the graphs and Carolina Blue is used to represent Ethanol (E85) which plays a vital role in our story.
